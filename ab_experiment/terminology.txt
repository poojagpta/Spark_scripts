Sample Size and number of days experiment should run.

A/B experiment based on hypthesis testing:
Ho (Null hypothesis): No effect.
H1: Significant effect.
           |
   True    | False
   Negatuve| Positive (alpha)      Actual
           | Type I (significance level)
-----------|---------------
 False     |.  True Positive
 Negative  |   
 (Type II)
  
  Predicted value      
 Type II error: Means incorrectly fail to reject null hypothesis  
  
  
Formula used for sample size = 16 * power((stdv),2)/power(Mimium defectable effect,2).

Number of days = Number of user in each group/number of sample size

If too many experiement going on : significance level /number of tests

Lift: New rate - old rate/old rate

In case of Streaming Lift: 
(a.play_hours/a.activations) / (b.play_hours/b.activations) -1 

Probability( 97.5) == Z score of (1.96)

(RateA - RateB)/ sqroot( pow(a.stdv,2)/a.activation+ pow(b.stdv,2)/b.activation) )>1.96
